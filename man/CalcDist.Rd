\description{
This function fits separate multivariate densities to each sample.
As input, the function expects a named list with names corresponding to sample IDs,
and elements holding a matrix or data.frame of dimensionality reduced cells from the samples.
Each matrix-type will have rows corresponding to each cell and columns corresponding to
the cells projection into a latent dimension. The k-nearest neighbour algorithm
does density and distance estimation in a single step, and for that `dens` specification
this function simply returns the input embedding matrices (see R/calc_dist.R).

This function calculates a statistical divergences between
two specified samples of an input list of sample GloScope representations. Different
subroutines are called depending on the divergence specified (symmetric KL or Jensen-Shannon)
and density estimation used for the GloScope representations (GMM or KNN).

This calculates the symmetric KL divergence between two
GloScope representations. This is implemented with Monte Carlo approximation
(with an optional epsilon perturbation term) if GMM is used for the density
estimate of each cell or a plug-in formula if KNN is used for the density.
