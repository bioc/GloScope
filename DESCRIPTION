Description: This package aims at representing and summarizing the entire single-cell profile of 
  a sample. It allows researchers to perform important bioinformatic analyses at the sample-level 
  such as visualization and quality control. The main functions Estimate sample distribution and calculate
  statistical divergence among samples, and visualize the distance matrix through MDS plots.
